What i’d like you to write is a Pig Latin translator that should take in text and translate it. Pig Latin is a joke variation of english where 2 main rules apply:

words starting with consonants have those consonants moved to the end of the word, and then “ay” is applied
words starting with vowels have “way” appended to the end.
Ex: “pig” -> “igpay”, “arrow” -> “arrowway”

Time should be a factor in your solution, but you should prioritize a solution you are proud of over speed. Feel free to just attach your solution file(s) in your response. I’ll be around for the next couple of hours if you have any questions.
